# Liqui-Planner

This project is a result of following the tutorial "The Ultimate JavaScript Complete Course" on Udemy. The goal of the tutorial was to learn JavaScript and its various features by building a Liqui-Planner application.

The Liqui-Planner is a web application designed to help users manage their income and expenses. Users can add entries for income and expenses, including the title, type (income or expense), amount, and date. The application allows users to track and organize their financial transactions, arranging them by date and month.

Throughout the tutorial, a wide range of JavaScript concepts and techniques were covered, including variables, data types, functions, objects, arrays, loops, conditionals, and event handling. These concepts were utilized to develop the core functionality of the Liqui-Planner, enabling users to interact with the application and effectively manage their income and expenses.

## Key Features

- Entry Management: Users can add income and expense entries, providing the title, type, amount, and date.
- Date and Month Organization: The application arranges the entries based on date and month, allowing users to easily track their financial transactions.
- Calculation: The application calculates the total income and expenses for each month, providing users with an overview of their financial situation.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive interface for easy entry and management of financial transactions.
- Persistence: The application stores the entry data locally, allowing users to access and review their financial records even after closing and reopening the application.

## Learning Experience

By completing this tutorial and building the Liqui-Planner, I gained valuable hands-on experience in JavaScript. The project allowed me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios.

Throughout the tutorial, I learned about variables, data types, functions, objects, arrays, loops, conditionals, and event handling in JavaScript. I also learned how to manipulate and organize data, calculate totals, and create a user-friendly interface using JavaScript.

The project provided a practical context for applying JavaScript skills and reinforced my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. It helped me develop problem-solving skills and improve my ability to think programmatically.

I also gained experience in working with local storage to persist data, which enhanced my understanding of data management in web applications.

Overall, this project served as an excellent learning exercise and provided a solid foundation in JavaScript. It equipped me with practical skills that can be applied to future JavaScript projects and web development endeavors.
